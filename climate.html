                <h2>
                    Climate Change: A Call to Action
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Climate Change is a complex problem, and often people are not sure what it means or how severe it is, and how they should be dealing with it.  Activities, such as burning fossil fuels and transportation, are the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions that led to Climate Change.  The increase in temperature due to Climate Change has been the cause of various natural disasters, water shortages, and destruction of habitats and biodiversity.  On March 13, 2023, the approval of the Willow project by the Biden Administration, became a concerning issue that, if acted on, will contribute drastically to carbon emissions by an insane amount, setting back the efforts of reducing Climate Change by years.  It highlights the need for everyone to take action to reduce their carbon footprint and work towards an environmentally sustained world.  Climate Change is a pressing issue on our planet and should be treated as a higher priority due to its major impact on the environment, economy, and overall human well-being.  It is not enough to write and talk about Climate Change; action needs to be taken to help safeguard to future of our planet.

                    Climate Change is a change in Earth’s average conditions over a period, typically throughout history, the Earth has gotten warmer.   According to “Climate Change Terms and Definitions”, Climate Change is connected to the rising levels of greenhouse gases, such as carbon in the Earth’s atmosphere.  This quote explains that human activities are typically responsible for the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which is causing Climate Change.  The way greenhouse gases work is that the Earth’s atmosphere has a balance of naturally occurring gases that trap some of the heat from the sun near the Earth’s surface which creates a greenhouse effect that keeps the Earth’s temperature stable.   Due to air pollution from human activities that create excess carbon pollution, the balance of the Earth’s greenhouse gases is thrown off making warmer temperatures across the Earth.   Since 1981, the average temperature has increased by 1.28 degrees Fahrenheit, this change is due to burning excessive fossil fuels and clearing forests which adds around 11 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere each year.   Transportation is another large contributor towards greenhouse gases, accounting for around 27 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. which makes it the biggest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions.

                    Why is Climate Change and the rising temperatures of Earth such a bad thing?  According to “Climate Change, Society and Health Inequities”, Climate Change is more detrimental in poorer locations as they are more vulnerable to natural disasters and the economic impacts from nature.  An example of a location that has been affected by this is in the slum area of Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya.  Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa and is home to over one million people.  The slum is in a low-lying area that is prone to flooding due to rainfall, and a lack of proper drainage systems.  In 2018, heavy rainfall caused flooding in Kibera that resulted in the displacement of thousands of people and destroyed lots of people’s homes and property.  The heavy rainfall was due to the increasing temperatures, which cause more intense storms and higher sea levels, which lead to an excessive amount of rainfall.  The residents of Kibera lack access to basic services such as clean water and sanitation, making them particularly vulnerable to the effects of flooding.  Coastal areas are also more likely to experience extreme weather such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts, which can lead to less crops, food and water shortages, and the destruction and loss of buildings, which further increases the economic and social consequences of Climate Change.  Another key term that Climate Change effects is the Biodiversity of Earth.  “Biodiversity refers to the variety of living species on Earth, such as plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi” (National Geographic Society).  Climate Change has a negative impact on the biodiversity because it is leading to changes in the distribution and abundance of certain species as well as alternating their timing of seasonal events and interactions with other species.  Rising temperature and changing precipitation patterns can affect the ecosystems, habitats, and food sources of species, which leads to population declines and an unbalanced circle of life.  An example of this is if flowering plants bloom earlier than the arrival of their pollinators, then the plants do not get pollinated, causing the pollinators to be left without food, and the flower to be left unpollinated.  Climate Change is affecting the biodiversity of Earth and should be addressed.  If the biodiversity becomes bad enough to the point where it affects the planets health, or the Earth stops functioning, then all of humanity would be at risk.

                    A current event example of Climate Change in action is the approval of the Willow Project in Alaska by the Biden administration on March 13, 2023, is a concerning problem that will have a bad impact on the future of the Earth.  While it may generate a significant amount of oil, it comes at an enormous cost to the environment.  According to CNN the project is estimated to release a staggering 9.2 million metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere, contributing significantly to the already dire issue of Climate Change.  The release of such a massive amount of carbon is detrimental to our planet and the human population.  Climate Change is already causing devastating effects worldwide, including increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, rising sea levels, and extreme weather conditions.  The approval of the Willow Project not only increases the severity of these problems but also sends a message that our leaders are willing to prioritize short term economic gains over long term environmental sustainability.  Furthermore, the impacts of the Willow Project go beyond just the carbon emissions.  Drilling for oil in Alaska has tons of environmental risks, such as the potential for oil spills and contamination of local ecosystems.  The Arctic is a particularly sensitive region, and any damage caused by the Willow Project could have long lasting and irreversible consequences.  The approval of the Willow Project is an irresponsible decision by the Biden administration.  The risks associated with the oil drilling in Alaska are not worth the short-term economic benefits at the cost of our planet.

                    Saving the Earth from Climate Change will require efforts from individuals, businesses, and governments.  There are lots of actions that people can take to directly contribute to the health of our planet, including reducing your carbon footprint by using public transportation, or walking and biking to locations instead of driving, reducing energy usage in your house and buildings that you are in control of, making sustainable choices in your food and consumer purchases by buying products that are recyclable so that it minimizes the contributions to greenhouse gases, recycling materials that can be reused and reducing the amount of waste that you go through.  A good way to start is by setting goals such as a points system, where you get points for doing tasks such as recycling, or using a bike when you can, or eating a plant based meal.

                    It is not all bad, on October 29, 2021, Team Seas, created by Mark Rober who is an Ex-Nasa Engineer, is a project that is dedicated to removing waste in the Ocean.  Their goal of raising $30 million USD to remove 30 million pounds of waste in polluting oceans, seas and coastal regions is a huge step in addressing the issue of pollution.  The oceans are home to a massive variety of species that play an important role in our planet’s ecosystem; however, they are also under threat from pollution caused by humans.  The waste that ends up in our oceans can be incredibly damaging to marine life, causing entanglement, ingestion, and suffocation.  Team Seas’ mission of raising $30 million will go to two organizations called The Ocean Cleanup, and Ocean Conservancy.  The project will target pollution in Indonesia, and the Dominican Republic.  Team Seas’ initiative will be an inspiration for others to act and get involved in environmental causes.  The project has demonstrated that small actions can lead to significant results, and that every person can make a difference in protecting our planet’s health by just showing a little bit of compassion for the future of our planet.

                    There are lots of different actions that businesses and individuals can take to help fight Climate Change.  Businesses can implement sustainable practices, such as reducing energy consumption and waste, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and using sustainable materials.  They can also engage in carbon offsetting, which involves investing in projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, employers can encourage their employees and customers to adopt ecofriendly behaviors, such as rideshare, and using ecofriendly products and implementing recycling options for on site use.  Individuals can take action to fight Climate Change by using energy-efficient appliances, reducing energy consumption, driving less, and using public transportation, eating a plant-based diet, and reducing waste through recycling and composting.  Additionally, individuals can advocate for climate action by contacting their elected officials and participating in local environmental groups.  By taking actions, both businesses and individuals can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating the effects of Climate Change.

                    Climate Change is a complicated challenge that does not have a simple solution, and it is often discarded since it does not have an instant impact on humanity, but it is exponentially getting worse, and people are getting too comfortable getting into bad habits that have a negative effect on the planet.  However, there is still time to do something about it, and progress is being made through the adoption of renewable energy, and sustainability practices such as recycling and ecofriendly materials.  It is important though that individuals, businesses, and governments continue to work together to create a sustainable future, where the effects of Climate Change are minimal not threatening to the future of the Earth.  There are lots of opportunities to get involved in the fight against Climate Change, and plenty of steps people can take to minimize their carbon footprint on the Earth.  It is important to be outspoken and proactive about how we need to be doing more to ensure that future generations can experience the beautiful and exotic places of Earth, and that our species does not come to an end.
