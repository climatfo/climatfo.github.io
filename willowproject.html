                <h2>
                    The Willow Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Willow Project is an oil drilling project that will release 277 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere. The large amount of carbon will be detrimental to the future of the fight against climate change.  The Willow Project cannot be allowed to go through without some form of compensation that will greatly reduce the impact it has on the future of the Earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Willow Project by ConocoPhillips is the biggest oil drilling project on American territory ever, it will be done in Alaska’s North Slope in the National Petroleum Reserve, which is owned by the government.  The location holds 600 million barrels of oil.  There is no information about when the project is due to start, but it has been given the green light by the Biden administration.

                    The argument for the Willow Project is that Alaskan legislators argue that the Willow Project would boost domestic energy production, create job opportunities, and reduce the country’s dependence on foreign oil.  In March, all three lawmakers from Alaska’s bipartisan congressional delegation met with President Biden and his senior advisors to request the approval of the project.  Moreover, a coalition of Alaska Native groups on the North Slope supports the project and views it as a potential source of revenue for the region.  The funds generated could support critical services such as education and health care.  The argument against the Willow Project is that Alaskan Natives that live closer to the planned Willow Project, such as city officials and tribal members from the Native village of Nuiqsut, express grave concerns over the project’s potential health and environmental impacts.  The Mayor of Nuiqsut wrote a letter to Secretary Deb Haaland highlighting that their village would be significantly affected by the negative consequences of Willow.  The letter further states that while other villages receive financial benefits from oil and gas operations, they also experience fewer negative impacts than Nuiqsut, as they are closer to where the operation is taking place.  Additionally, there is tons of online activism opposing the Willow Project, on social media platforms resulting in over one million letters sent to the Biden administration and over 2.8 million signatures on a change.org petition demanding the project be stopped.  Another argument against the Willow Project is that it will release tons of carbon into the atmosphere, but there is also supply and demand still and a counter argument to that is that if we don’t drill for the oil, other countries could.

                    There could be a couple of solutions to the Willow Project, such as increasing the cost of using a gas-powered car, and increasing the amount of electric vehicles available, but these solutions would need to be done at an international level, because if the US makes using a gas car more expensive, it could just get less expensive in another country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the Willow Project is a huge dent in the fight against climate change, but it is also creating a lot of awareness and activism and hopefully will inspire people to become more educated and advocate for a greater change.
