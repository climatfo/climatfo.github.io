                    There is No Planet B is a book that explores the challenges we face as a society in addressing the issues of the environment and offers solutions to the issues.  The book goes over a variety of topics, such as the effects of food on the environment, climate change, energy, travel and transportation, money metrics and growth, and people and work.  The book is filled with information, without unnecessary padding of unneeded information; but in so, does not include any stories, just hard factual statistics.

                    Mike Berners-Lee is a researcher on carbon foot printing at Lancaster University.  He graduated in Physics from the University of Oxford in 1986 and got his master’s from Sheffield Hallam University in 2001.<sup>vi</sup>

                    In Chapter one, Berners-Lee talks about Food, such as how humanity is fed, and how we can do better in the future.  In this chapter, he looks at the source of energy for humans, and how it could improve the biodiversity that is currently in shambles.  This chapter was the longest in the book but had plenty of graphs and facts such as “On average we need 2,350 kcal per day, but we actually eat about 180 kcal more than that” (pg. 13).  Chapter two was all about climate change, this chapter talked all about carbon emissions, and fossil fuels and greenhouse gases, and had some interesting graphs, for example there was one about how carbon dioxide emissions have grown exponentially for 160 years by 1.8% growth per year.  This chapter also talked about how we have not yet dented the carbon curve, which is a huge deal, that eventually could be irreversible if people do not act soon.  This chapter also went over biodiversity stats, such as the fact that there are around 10 million species, and we around 0.1% to 0.01% are going extinct every year, which means around 1,000 to 10,000 species are going extinct every year, which is an insane amount.

                    Overall, the book is structured super well, and it is easy to read and remember the information that it gives you.  The formatting of this book was also super good, with it starting out with more relevant information, and then preceding to talk about how it affects different subjects.
